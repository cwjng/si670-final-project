# Cancer Mortality Rates

## Overview

This dataset examines factors that affect cancer mortality rates across U.S. counties. The dataset contains county-level data for a random sample of 537 counties. Data were aggregated from multiple public sources, including the American Community Survey (census.gov), clinicaltrials.gov, and cancer.gov.

The dataset can be used for exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and research on the relationships between demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors and cancer mortality outcomes.
